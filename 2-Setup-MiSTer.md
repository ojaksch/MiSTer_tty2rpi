# Setting up MiSTer

- Open a ssh-shell to your MiSTer or open a console at MiSTer and logon.
- Type in
```
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ojaksch/MiSTer_tty2rpi/main/update_tty2rpi.sh -O - | bash
```
This will download and setup the needed files for MiSTer. You can use *update_tty2rpi.sh* to keep this up to date. 
Read The next chapter for a description of the used INI files and the last needed step to set and activate tty2rpi.

# The INI files

There are two INI files: tty2rpi-system.ini and tty2rpi-user.ini which are read and evaluated by the daemon in that order. tty2rpi-user.ini is overwriting values done by tty2rpi-system.ini
tty2rpi-system.ini contains the system wide variables and definitions. Do not edit this file as it will be overwritten when doing an update!
For your own favorite variables please use tty2rpi-user.ini and take over and edit the needed line from tty2rpi-system.ini. All useful variables are commented - see "# Userdata" in tty2rpi
-system.ini

**IMPORTANT**  
When setting up tty2rpi for the first time by running *update_tty2rpi.sh*, you'll see a notice to edit tty2rpi-user.ini and set the IP of your RPi there. 
Change the value **IP-ADDRESS-OF-RPI** to the IP address or FQDN of your RPi and re-run update_tty2rpi.sh
